\label{sec:related}
We list here relevant works that should be taken into account:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \cite{aumentado19} (ICCV19): Autoencoder that disantangle intrinsic and estrinsic deformations into the latent space, by imposing a relation between a subset of latent variables and eigenvalues of LBO. \emph{No code available} 
\end{itemize}
